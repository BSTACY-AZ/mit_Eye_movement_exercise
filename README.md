# mit_Eye_movement_exercise
Using HTML/javaScript/CSS in combination with mouse events to bind DOM elements to events

# Description
This was written as the result of an exercise within the MIT xPro Full Stack with MERN course, module 8. The concepts covered by this particular module were intended to incorporate using mouse events to bind DOM elements to events.

# Languages
javaScript/HTML/CSS

# Installation/Usage
1) Extract all contents to a folder
2) load the index.html the folder used in step 1 into the browser of your choice
3) Move the mouse around the eyes shown on the browser window, the pupils of the eyes should follow the mouse cursor

# Roadmap
In the future I would like to update the code for this project to: 
1) Identify if I can get the eyes to function more like actual eyes when the cursor is in between them on the x axis (e.g. make the eyes cross for instance)
